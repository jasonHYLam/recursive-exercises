# recursive-exercises

## What I've Learned

- Debugging in VSCode using the chrome web environment.
- Recreating the array method .every() to determine if all array elements pass a condition, with recursion. Requires .shift() and checking if the first element is false or not.
- Understanding that the return keyword is the trail between a call and a subcall.
- If looping through Object values or an array to find a value, don't return false. Instead return true if found, else return false.
- Sometimes if statements to catch unwanted values (eg. empty arrays and strings) are required.
- Understanding that recursion reaches the final step, and repeatedly goes back to subsequent function calls with returned values, until the first is reached.
- Recursion is a triangle.
